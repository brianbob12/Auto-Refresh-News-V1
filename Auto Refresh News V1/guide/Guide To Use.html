		<h2>What the tool can do:</h2>
		<br>
		<p>
		The Auto Refresh News can inform you as to when a specific online publication
		has released as story. The tool searches the website for changes in keywords
		wich indicate an article relevant to the user. If the tool finds that the
		website of the publication changed, it will email you.
		</p>
		<br>
		<br>
		<h2>Limitations</h2>
		<ul>
			<li>The tool is unable to monitor publications that reqire logins to acess articles.</li>
			<li>The tool can only detect changes in the keywords for the publication. If the keywords remain unchanged when a website of a publiction is updated, the email notiification will not be sent.</li>
			<li>The tool reqires python to be installed on the system that it is running on.</li>
			<li>The tool can slow down and break if there are too many keywords and publications</li>
		</ul>
