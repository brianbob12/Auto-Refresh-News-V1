		<h2>unexpected crash or program won't start</h2>
		<p>
		The most likley cause of a crash is an error derived from having too many
		webpages and keywords in the same group. This causes the program to run out
		of allocated computer memory. In order to fix this issue the group must be
		split up and smaller groups must be used. No group should have more than 50
		publications or 50 keywords as it is too intensive on the machine.
		<br>
		<p>
		The crash could possibly be due to a lack of internet connection or key files.
		If there are missing flies, reinstall the software. 
		</p>
		<h2>Reciving Emails Too Ofen</h2>
		<p>
		This issue is caused by the selected keywords changing constantly between
		website loads. The keyword and website at fult can be identified in the
		"keywords:" section of the email. Remove this keyword by navigating to the
		page for that webpage fromt he main menu and clicking on the red box
		containing this keyword.
		</p>
		<h2>Not Reciving Emails When Publication Is Updated</h2>
		<p>
		This is most likley caused because the keywords are not applicable for the
		specific pages. To fix this, more keywods should be added.
		</p>
		<h2>Windows prompts with, "how do you what to open this file"</h2>
		<p>
		This is caused by the inncorrect installation of python. Refer to the installation guaide <a href="Installation.html">here</a>.
